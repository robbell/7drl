# 7DRL

The beginnings of my Seven Day Roguelike entry.

## To do
* Animations
    * Player
    * Tile
* Enemies
* Turns
* Lighting
* Theme
    * Cyberpunk - East Asian asthetic, gang wars, underhive, tunnels, planet levels, puzzles - too similar to last year's winner?
    * Underwater - find air in caves, underwater creatures, hidden cities, tile visibility reduces (depth and fade rate)
        * combine with above? Abandoned research station on old planet?
        * possible levels: landing pad, station, ocean floor, scuba gear, ghosts, sea monsters
    * Traditional dungeon - you play the monster, fight off questing champions
    * Mad Max style wasteland - machine bosses, sand storms, infiltrate enemy bases
* Graphics
* More graphic optimisation
* FPS

## Done
* Movement
* Map generation
* Collision detection
* Line of sight
* General tidy up from top to bottom
* Graphic optimisation
* FPS
